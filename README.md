  Type 'node index.js' on the command line to start the server.

  Since this is currently just a back-end, you can add, update, and delete using insomnia.

  Routes:

  Get all users and add new users
  /api/users

  Get a single user, update a user, or delete a user
  /api/users/:userId

  Add a friend or remove a friend
  /api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId

  Get all thoughts or add a thought
  /api/thoughts

  Get a single thought, update a thought, or delete a thought
  /api/thoughts/:thoughtId

  Add a reaction
  /api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions

  Remove a reaction
  /api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions/:reactionId
